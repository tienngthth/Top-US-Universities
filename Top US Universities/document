Introduce the app.
Why do you choose that topic? Any motivation or inspiration?
Explain about what the app about? How do we use it?
What are the main features and extra creative features you have done?
Screenshots of different views of the app.
Possible links to animated picture/GIF/Video of the app for easy visualization. (Very important for me to visualize your project if your code somehow does not compiled or run upon submission)
Any potential idea for future features you want to build for this app later on.
